# Sejal-Choudhary-Portfolio

## Template 

The template inspiration was from [UIdeck](https://uideck.com/). I chose a simple, work-related, customizable template.

## Source Code

Downloaded the sample code for the template and personalized it accordingly in Visual Studio Code.

## Portfolio

The portfolio includes the following details:
- A short-description
- Education
- Projects and link to their source code (GitHub)
- Work Experience (Internships and Open-Source)
- Link to the resume
- Contact Details (Email Id)
- Social Media links (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook)

## Deployment through GitHub

1. Created a repository with username.github.io, i.e., sejal129.github.io
2. Navigated to the local project directory and created a local git repository.
```
git init
```
3. Executed the following commands to commit and push the code into GitHub repository
```                                                  
git add -A                                                         
git commit -m "commit message"                                    
git remote add origin https://github.com/sejal129/sejal129.github.io.git    
git pull origin master                                             
git push -u origin master 
```
4. Hence, the portfolio website was hosted through GitHub: [Sejal Choudhary](https://sejal129.github.io/)
